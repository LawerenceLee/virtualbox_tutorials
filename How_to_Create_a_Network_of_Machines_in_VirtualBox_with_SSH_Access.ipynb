    "# How to Create a Network of Machines in VirtualBox with SSH Access\n",

    "#### Instructions\n",
    "* Go to File > Host Network Manager, and click Create.\n",
    "* Go to DHCP Setting, and Disable them. Were giving our machines static IPs.\n",
    "* Select the Ubuntu Desktop you have installed, and click settings. \n",
    "* Naviagate to the Network Tab, check out the settings for adapter 1. 'Attached to:' should be set to NAT, and it should be enabled.\n",
    "    * This will allow our guests to make an internet connection through our host connection.\n",
    "* Go to adapter 2, enable it, and change 'Attached to:' to Host-only Adapter. Be sure its Name is set to the same one we just created in the Host Network Manager\n",
    "* Go to the Base Ubuntu Desktop you created, Ctrl click and select Clone.\n",
    "* Name the clone 'ubuntu-1', and click the checkbox that reinitalizes the MAC address of all network cards.\n",
    "* Select Full Clone\n",
    "* Select Current Machine State, and click clone.s\n",
    "* Repeat the process, but change the clone's name to 'ubuntu-2'.\n",
    "* Launch both Clones and log in using your original credentials from the base machine you cloned from.\n",
    "* Open terminal in both, and check to make sure they have an internet connection. You can do this by typing `ping google.com`.\n",
    "* Now we need to change the hostnames of both machines, because they are identical, which is not what we want.\n",
    "* BOTH MACHINES: Do this by typing `sudo nano /etc/hostname`. \n",
    "    * Remove both hostnames currently in the files and change one to ubuntu-1, and the other to ubuntu-2.\n",
    "    * Type Ctrl-X, y, and press enter.\n",
    "* BOTH MACHINES: And typing `sudo nano /etc/hosts`. \n",
    "    * Change the name under localhost to the name used in /etc/hostname.\n",
    "    * Type Ctrl-X, y, and press enter.\n",
    "* BOTH MACHINES: Type `ifconfig -a`.\n",
    "    * The `inet addr:` is bound to our first adapter\n",
    "    * We are going to set enp0s8's `inet addr:` to the ip address in our Host Network Manager"

    "    * Those changes shouldn't need a reboot to take affect, but better safe then sorry.\n",
    "* BOTH MACHINES: Log Back in, and open terminal.\n",
    "    * Should see that the hostname has changed.\n",
    "* BOTH MACHINES: Re-run the `ifconfig -a` command.\n",
    "    * The static ip address you assigned to enp0s8 should now show up.\n",
