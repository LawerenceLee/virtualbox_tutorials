    "# VirtualBox: How to Use Snapshots\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What are Snapshots?\n",
    "* Allows one to save the state of a VM, and then restore the VM to that state at later date.\n",
    "* They allows to quickly roll back changes without needing to a complete reinstall and re-configuration.\n",
    "#### How to create them:\n",
    "* Select desired machine.\n",
    "* Click on 'Machine Tools'.\n",
    "* Go to 'Snapshots'.\n",
    "* Click on the 'Take' Icon, and fill in name/description\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Case - Two Web Server Clients, Two Snapshots, One VM.\n",
    "#### : First Snapshot\n",
    "* In Terminal type `service apache2 status`\n",
    "* Will say that apache can't be found\n",
    "* To install type `sudo apt-get install apache2 -y`\n",
    "* Once completed power down the VM\n",
    "* Go to Snapshots menu once again and make a Snapshot.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Second Snapshot\n",
    "* Go to the Snapshots menu, if you're not there already.\n",
    "* Select a previous Snapshot and click Restore.\n",
    "* Now power up your VM once again.\n",
    "* In terminal type `sudo apt-get install nginx`.\n",
    "* Once installed, shutdown VM.\n",
    "* Make a new Snapshot of the VM.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you can test both Apache, and Nginx on the same Virtual Machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Snapshots while your VM is Running\n",
    "* A snapshot while the VM is off captures settings, and the state of the file system.\n",
    "* A snapshot while the VM is running captures the current state of the memory in its entirety, as well as aformentioned. \n",
    "    * This can be useful should you need to shutdown a machine mid-download, or something to that effect.\n",
    "    * However, keep in mind that a Snapshot taken while the machine is running creates a very large file, perhaps equal to the size of the VM's virtual disk itself.\n"
